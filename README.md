# WARE - Wet AMD Risk Evaluation

WARE is a software for calculating the risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), taking into account relevant genetic and environmental factors. It aims to help specialists in reporting risk assessment upon patient evaluation. 
A pleasant and easy-to-use web page interface guides the user in setting genotypes for selected SNPs and calculates total genetic risk, also showing nice plots about absolute and relative risk with respect to AMD and general population. Subsequently, the user can take into account patient's Familiarity and Smoke, calculating a total risk for both genetic and environmental risk factors.

WARE is an open-source platform-independent browser-based interface for AMD risk assessment in R. The application is based on the Shiny package and can be run locally or on a server. WARE was developed using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), see [papers section](#papers) for details and citations.
